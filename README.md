# Pong in Processing 

This was one of my very early projects (2017) where I set out to create pong within Processing for fun. 
After I managed to get the initial game mechanics down, I added a few features to make the gameplay harder...
including shrinking paddle and speeding up the ball in proportion to the player's score.
